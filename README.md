# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `bug.css` file contains examples of these errors, while `bugSolution.css` shows the corrected code.

**Errors Covered:**

* Incompatible units within a single `calc()` expression.
* Missing spaces around operators in `calc()` expressions.
* Improperly nested `calc()` functions leading to unexpected behavior.

This is a simple example, but illustrates potential pitfalls when dealing with calculations within your CSS.
