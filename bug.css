The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there are some less common errors that can occur.  One issue is using `calc()` with incompatible units. For instance, you cannot directly add `px` and `%` values within a single `calc()` expression.  Another is forgetting that `calc()` requires spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /).  Finally, using nested `calc()` functions without proper parentheses can lead to unexpected results. For example, `width: calc(calc(100% - 10px) - 20px);` is more clearly written as `width: calc(100% - 30px);`
